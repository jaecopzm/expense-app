3. Generate release notes

## Alternative Options

### Option 2: Personal Access Token (PAT)

**When to use:** If you need to trigger other workflows or access multiple repos

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (fine-grained)"
3. Set permissions:
   - Contents: Read and Write
   - Releases: Read and Write
4. Copy the token
5. Add to repository secrets:
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - New secret: `PAT_TOKEN`
   - Paste your token
6. Update workflow file (line 178):
   ```yaml
   GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}
   ```

**Pros:** More permissions, can trigger workflows
**Cons:** Manual setup, needs renewal
